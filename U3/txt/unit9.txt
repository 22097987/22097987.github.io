We will see graphics at work whenever we're surfing websites, playing computer games,
going shopping or reading a user manual. Graphics are used to communicate messages
in every part of our lives, such as advertising, music, fashion, interior design and
architecture. It is the job role of a graphic designer to create digital graphics, that
bring colour, information and interest to our lives for a wide range of industries.

In this unit we will investigate a range of applications and features of existing graphic
products and consider their audience and purpose. We will be able to apply some of
what we discover to your own digital graphic products.

We will design, create and test graphic products in a similar way to how it is done in
industry and be introduced to the technology and techniques used by professionals.
We will need to think about the creative aspects of the product as well as the technical
(both vector-editing and photo-editing).
 Once finished, we will review the products,
having obtained feedback from others, and evaluate possible improvements.
