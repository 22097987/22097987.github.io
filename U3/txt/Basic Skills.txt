Creating a personal progression plan can help me to prepare for the future and provide direction towards achieving your personal and professional goals and support personal growth and wellbeing.
For a progression plan to be useful to you, it should reflect where you are today and where you want to be in the future.
It should also help you to identify short-, mid- and long-term tasks to aid your progression.
