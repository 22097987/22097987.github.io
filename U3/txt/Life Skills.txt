We all face different choices when we finish full-time education.
Some people may carry on learning in a further or higher education college or be accepted into university.
You may go onto an apprenticeship programme to work and study at the same time.
The appeal of working for yourself may interest some people or part-time work may be more appropriate in meeting personal needs.
Whatever choice you make, you will anticipate receiving money for the work you do or support for your studies.
The amount of money you receive will vary depending on what you do but there is also support for those receiving a low income.
Being financially aware will help with your personal growth and wellbeing.
